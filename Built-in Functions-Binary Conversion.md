# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
a=16 
print(bin(a)
```

## Output

![438826667-740cd71d-506b-4f8a-a0b7-5fe8554481a1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35ff9d16-8dc8-42f9-aa6f-7484815a3bb2)

## Result
Thus, the program as executed successfully
